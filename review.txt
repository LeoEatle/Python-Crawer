1. This is a simple crawer program which can catch the url of other website in a html file.
2. I use a regular expression to match the url which have "http:" as head and ".shtml" as tail. But it cause some mistaken urls. May be I can make a better regular expression to make the result more accurate.
3. I can improve my class to match more important information such as pictures.
